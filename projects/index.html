        <p class="fs-6">
            Implemented a LQR controller for a quarter car model to continuously control the vertical movement of the
            vehicle wheel using an actively controlled actuator placed on the suspension axis. Designed a neural network
            and trained it using supervised based on data collected from LQR controller. A JavaScript simulation is
            created based on the real system for training the neural network on an evolutionary algorithm (Neuro
            Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) implemented in JavaScript to have a better control than the LQR
            controller.

        <p class="fs-6">
            Vibrational data is received from a piezoelectric transducer and sent to a server which takes the data and
            performs a Fourier transform to convert the data from amplitude domain to time domain. The transformed data
            is then sent to neural network to predict the condition of the bolt.

            Designed and fabricate a mechanism to solve the Rubik’s cube. Write the program to solve the Rubik cube in
            python for entering the current state of the cube. Another python code generates the algorithm to solve the
            cube. The algorithm is then deployed to an Arduino with two servo motors for control to perform the
            manipulations on the cube.

        </p>

        <p class="fs-6">
            Using the above ML framework, a simple image classification tool is created to showcase the framework.
            This project is heavily inspired by the Google’s project, Teachable Machine. It allows user to add their own
            images through the camera and label them as required and train the neural network using backpropagation.
            After the neural network is trained, the user can classify images captured by their camera in real-time.

        <p class="fs-6">
            This project allows multiple clients to draw figures on the same canvas simultaneously which can be used to
            play collaborative games. Node.js was used as backend and Express was used to run the server. The
            communication between the clients and the server was carried out using Socket.io.

        <p class="fs-6">
            Created a flappy bird type game on the browser using HTML5 Canvas and p5.js. Used the above ML framework to
            create a simple neural network to control the movement of the bird. The neural network is given simple
            inputs such as the bird’s velocity, position and the pipe’s positions, velocity. It then predicts to flap
            its wing or not. The neural network is trained on an evolutionary algorithm implemented in JavaScript.

        <p class="fs-6">
            An Arduino is used to actuate remote experiments and collect the vibrational data from the experiments. A
            Node.js program is used to command the Arduino using a JavaScript library, johnny-five. An Express server is
            created and localtunnel.me software is used to tunnel the local server to the internet. Socket.io is used to
            communicate between the server and the clients.
